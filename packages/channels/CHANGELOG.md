## 0.5.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- f085a55: **Attachment Gateway (P0/P1): directional media capabilities + Generic Attachment compatibility backend.**

  - **Directional `capabilities.media`** (`channel-core`): an optional per-kind media map is added to `ChannelCapabilities` — inbound `'bytes' | 'locator' | 'unsupported'`, outbound `'bytes' | 'unsupported'` — alongside the legacy coarse `image` / `file` / `audio` / `video` booleans (retained for compatibility). `channel-verify` now checks `capabilities.media` when a kind claims `'bytes'` (fixtures must prove `localData` before emit).
  - **Inbound binary hydration extended to audio/video**: Telegram, QQ, DingTalk and Weixin best-effort hydrate inbound audio/video to `localData`; DingTalk keeps its public audio/video verdict at `locator` pending official documentation plus a real-account live gate. Lark follows its official media API verdict. Hydration runs through the shared protocol-agnostic `applyHydrationResult` helper (`channel-core` media/hydration).
  - **Provider rename** (`channel-harness`): `ChannelFileProvider` → `ChannelAttachmentProvider` is now the canonical name, with deprecated `ChannelFile*` aliases (`ChannelFileProvider` / `ChannelFileContext` / `ChannelFileDescriptor`) retained; `installTools` becomes the optional `installCompatibilityTools` (keeps registering `read_channel_attachment` as a compatibility tool).
  - **channel-files as Generic Attachment compatibility backend**: session-scoped storage keeps legacy PDF/DOCX/XLSX/TXT extraction as compatibility behavior. Attachment Catalog v2 (`attachments/catalog/v2`), a native capability seam (interface + fake only) and lazy copy+verify migration infrastructure are added **default-off**, to be activated via public capability detection once Harness ships an official native generic attachment surface. Legacy `attachments/v1` remains permanently readable and is never rewritten or deleted on upgrade.
  - Multi-channel binary ingress contract runner (`runBinaryIngressContract`) is added to `channel-testkit`.

  No breaking changes: legacy capability booleans, `ChannelFile*` exports and existing tool registration semantics remain available.

- 213fd5c: **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` baseline — opens the 0.5.x release line (BREAKING).**

  0.5.x is version-line compatible with Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`, not runtime dual-compatible: users on Harness `0.1.0-rc.7` should stay on the 0.4.x line (`@wsz987/dsh-channels@0.4.2`). See `docs/compatibility-matrix.md` for the compatibility and verification matrix.

  BREAKING:

  - **Minimum Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`.** Every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` declaration is now the exact tested version `0.1.1-rc.2` (dependencies, devDependencies and peerDependencies — no `^`/ranges). Peer ranges no longer claim unverified prereleases as compatible; a verified newer Harness widens the explicit OR band (`0.1.1-rc.2 || <next-tested>`), never a caret. `channel-harness` adds the `dsh-host-apiproxy` and `dsh-user-questions` peers.
  - **Minimum Node 22.19** (`engines: ^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`), aligned with the official rc.2 runtime.
  - **Unknown slash commands are no longer sent to the model.** A syntactically valid but unregistered `/command` now gets a direct channel notice (`未知命令：/foo…`), matching the rc.2 official Host `unknown-command` semantics. There is no opt-back to the legacy fall-through.
  - **Legacy image compatibility removed.** The `imageCompatibility` config and the channel-side image rewrite are gone. Whether the current model sees an image (vision variant vs. deterministic text placeholder) is decided by the official Harness Image Pipeline at request projection; the durable session history keeps the original image attachment. Vision, text-only and DeepSeek Files paths need no channel-side special-casing.
  - **Web client requires the rc.2 client module graph.** `dsh.client.inject` is now only `["@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-locale"]`; `react`, `cordis`, `dsh-client-ui-primitives` and `dsh-client-ui-slots` are static shell identities and are no longer dynamically injected. Web clients older than the rc.2 module graph cannot load the Channels panel.

  Features / refactors:

  - **New-version check (prompt-only).** `channel-control` periodically checks the npm dist-tags of `@wsz987/dsh-channels` (24h TTL cache in the channel storage, offline/timeout/corrupt responses tolerated silently, zod-validated registry input; configurable via `channels-control.updateCheck`). When a newer version exists (stable installs compare against `latest`; prerelease installs against max(latest, next)), Web Settings → Channels shows an upgrade banner and the new `/version` channel command prints the bundle version, the Harness tested baseline and the same hint — two-step commands when crossing a release line, a single `plugin update` within the line. It only ever prompts; nothing is installed automatically, and the browser never contacts npm (it reads a sanitized host-side DTO via `GET /dsh-channels/api/v2/update-check`). `@wsz987/channel-control` is part of this lockstep bump so its own package version keeps tracking the installed bundle version.
  - **Question interactions rebuilt** (`channel-harness/src/interactions/`): one presenter, two official backends — Web profiles answer through the official ApiProxy mux contract, headless deployments register the channel as the official `UserQuestionProvider`. Uses the official domain model and schema (the hand-written protocol clone is removed), passes `intent` through, and headless no longer simulates an ApiProxy.
  - **Official Host RPC types.** Model selection and host-facing RPC surfaces use the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy` types; the duplicated hand-written type layer is removed.
  - **Session compatibility verified.** `ReplyRouter` passes the rc.2 session contract fixtures (16 cases) with zero implementation drift; persisted-resume and missing-binding paths follow the rc.2 session semantics.
  - **Governance follows the tested baseline, not npm `latest`.** `check:upstream` gates the `dsh-*` family against `HARNESS_TESTED_VERSION` (exact pins; registry must publish the baseline; rc residue or ranged peers fail). New `pnpm check:harness-compat` entry point and the non-blocking `pnpm check:harness-newer` report for versions published above the baseline; both are wired into `pnpm ci:check`.

### Patch Changes

- 6919d3e: Channel-triggered Harness turns that terminate with
  `turn/end.reason.kind = "error"` now return a safe terminal failure notice to
  the originating channel. `AUTH` failures hide raw provider diagnostics and
  display `API key is invalid`. No-output terminal turns also stop typing
  indicators correctly. Structured `QUOTA` diagnostics prefer their validated
  provider message over the raw status and JSON envelope.
