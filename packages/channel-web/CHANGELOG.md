## 0.5.1

### Minor Changes

- 213fd5c: **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.2` baseline — opens the 0.5.x release line (BREAKING).**

  0.5.x is version-line compatible with Harness `0.1.5-rc.2`, **not** runtime
  dual-compatible: on Harness `0.1.0-rc.7` / `0.1.1-rc.2` stay on
  `@wsz987/dsh-channels@0.4.2`. Upgrade the Harness CLI first, then reinstall the
  bundle. Full version/Node matrix and the per-scenario verification table live in
  [`docs/compatibility-matrix.md`](https://github.com/wsz987/dsh-channels/blob/main/docs/compatibility-matrix.md);
  the rc.1/rc.2 API diff record is in
  [`docs/harness-0.5.x-migration-plan.md`](https://github.com/wsz987/dsh-channels/blob/main/docs/harness-0.5.x-migration-plan.md).

  What breaking changes require attention on upgrade:

  - **Minimum Harness `0.1.5-rc.2`** (exact pins, no carets) and **minimum Node 22.19**.
  - **ApiProxy is gone** — the `channels-harness` inject no longer lists it; host
    model selection goes through `ctx.sessionController`.
  - **User Questions ride the official `user-questions/request` waterfall** — the
    ApiProxy mux and direct `UserQuestionProvider` backends are retired; a declined
    channel presentation delegates via `next()`.
  - **Durable reads use `sessionPersistence.open(id, 'read')`** — `persistence.inspect()`
    and `Session.events` are gone (`snapshotEvents()` instead).
  - **Unknown slash commands are rejected** instead of reaching the model.
  - Remove `imageCompatibility` from any existing config; image visibility is now
    decided entirely by the official Harness Image Pipeline.

  Also in this line: `/version` plus a prompt-only Web update check, `/mirror on|off`
  (opt-in web-turn mirroring, issue #5), `/bind <id> [confirm]` (issue #6), working
  outbound image sends through the channel asset store (issue #7), and durable
  bindings that survive restarts (issue #8).

### Patch Changes

- d0df3dc: Add canonical conversation discovery for access-policy configuration, including
  QQ group OpenID discovery and an explicit Web refresh control. Normalize QQ and
  DingTalk activation facts used by the shared access layer, and update Lark
  interactive question actions to the official Card 2.0 callback-button schema.
