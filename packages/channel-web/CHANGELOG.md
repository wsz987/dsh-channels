## 0.5.1

### Minor Changes

- 213fd5c: **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.2` baseline — opens the 0.5.x release line (BREAKING).**

  0.5.x is version-line compatible with Harness `0.1.5-rc.2`, **not** runtime
  dual-compatible: on Harness `0.1.0-rc.7` / `0.1.1-rc.2` stay on
  `@wsz987/dsh-channels@0.4.2`. Upgrade the Harness CLI first, then reinstall the
  bundle. Full version/Node matrix and the per-scenario verification table live in
  [`docs/compatibility-matrix.md`](https://github.com/wsz987/dsh-channels/blob/main/docs/compatibility-matrix.md);
  the rc.1/rc.2 API diff record is in
  [`docs/harness-0.5.x-migration-plan.md`](https://github.com/wsz987/dsh-channels/blob/main/docs/harness-0.5.x-migration-plan.md).

  What breaking changes require attention on upgrade:

  - **Minimum Harness `0.1.5-rc.2`** (exact pins, no carets) and **minimum Node 22.19**.
  - **ApiProxy is gone** — the `channels-harness` inject no longer lists it; host
    model selection goes through `ctx.sessionController`.
  - **User Questions ride the official `user-questions/request` waterfall** — the
    ApiProxy mux and direct `UserQuestionProvider` backends are retired; a declined
    channel presentation delegates via `next()`.
  - **Durable reads use `sessionPersistence.open(id, 'read')`** — `persistence.inspect()`
    and `Session.events` are gone (`snapshotEvents()` instead).
  - **Unknown slash commands are rejected** instead of reaching the model.
  - Remove `imageCompatibility` from any existing config; image visibility is now
    decided entirely by the official Harness Image Pipeline.

  Also in this line: `/version` plus a prompt-only Web update check, `/mirror on|off`
  (opt-in web-turn mirroring, issue #5), `/bind <id> [confirm]` (issue #6), working
  outbound image sends through the channel asset store (issue #7), and durable
  bindings that survive restarts (issue #8).

### Patch Changes

- d0df3dc: Add canonical conversation discovery for access-policy configuration, including
  QQ group OpenID discovery and an explicit Web refresh control. Normalize QQ and
  DingTalk activation facts used by the shared access layer, and update Lark
  interactive question actions to the official Card 2.0 callback-button schema.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 213fd5c: **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` baseline — opens the 0.5.x release line (BREAKING).**

  0.5.x is version-line compatible with Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`, not runtime dual-compatible: users on Harness `0.1.0-rc.7` should stay on the 0.4.x line (`@wsz987/dsh-channels@0.4.2`). See `docs/compatibility-matrix.md` for the compatibility and verification matrix.

  BREAKING:

  - **Minimum Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`.** Every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` declaration is now the exact tested version `0.1.1-rc.2` (dependencies, devDependencies and peerDependencies — no `^`/ranges). Peer ranges no longer claim unverified prereleases as compatible; a verified newer Harness widens the explicit OR band (`0.1.1-rc.2 || <next-tested>`), never a caret. `channel-harness` adds the `dsh-host-apiproxy` and `dsh-user-questions` peers.
  - **Minimum Node 22.19** (`engines: ^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`), aligned with the official rc.2 runtime.
  - **Unknown slash commands are no longer sent to the model.** A syntactically valid but unregistered `/command` now gets a direct channel notice (`未知命令：/foo…`), matching the rc.2 official Host `unknown-command` semantics. There is no opt-back to the legacy fall-through.
  - **Legacy image compatibility removed.** The `imageCompatibility` config and the channel-side image rewrite are gone. Whether the current model sees an image (vision variant vs. deterministic text placeholder) is decided by the official Harness Image Pipeline at request projection; the durable session history keeps the original image attachment. Vision, text-only and DeepSeek Files paths need no channel-side special-casing.
  - **Web client requires the rc.2 client module graph.** `dsh.client.inject` is now only `["@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-locale"]`; `react`, `cordis`, `dsh-client-ui-primitives` and `dsh-client-ui-slots` are static shell identities and are no longer dynamically injected. Web clients older than the rc.2 module graph cannot load the Channels panel.

  Features / refactors:

  - **New-version check (prompt-only).** `channel-control` periodically checks the npm dist-tags of `@wsz987/dsh-channels` (24h TTL cache in the channel storage, offline/timeout/corrupt responses tolerated silently, zod-validated registry input; configurable via `channels-control.updateCheck`). When a newer version exists (stable installs compare against `latest`; prerelease installs against max(latest, next)), Web Settings → Channels shows an upgrade banner and the new `/version` channel command prints the bundle version, the Harness tested baseline and the same hint — two-step commands when crossing a release line, a single `plugin update` within the line. It only ever prompts; nothing is installed automatically, and the browser never contacts npm (it reads a sanitized host-side DTO via `GET /dsh-channels/api/v2/update-check`). `@wsz987/channel-control` is part of this lockstep bump so its own package version keeps tracking the installed bundle version.
  - **Question interactions rebuilt** (`channel-harness/src/interactions/`): one presenter, two official backends — Web profiles answer through the official ApiProxy mux contract, headless deployments register the channel as the official `UserQuestionProvider`. Uses the official domain model and schema (the hand-written protocol clone is removed), passes `intent` through, and headless no longer simulates an ApiProxy.
  - **Official Host RPC types.** Model selection and host-facing RPC surfaces use the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy` types; the duplicated hand-written type layer is removed.
  - **Session compatibility verified.** `ReplyRouter` passes the rc.2 session contract fixtures (16 cases) with zero implementation drift; persisted-resume and missing-binding paths follow the rc.2 session semantics.
  - **Governance follows the tested baseline, not npm `latest`.** `check:upstream` gates the `dsh-*` family against `HARNESS_TESTED_VERSION` (exact pins; registry must publish the baseline; rc residue or ranged peers fail). New `pnpm check:harness-compat` entry point and the non-blocking `pnpm check:harness-newer` report for versions published above the baseline; both are wired into `pnpm ci:check`.
